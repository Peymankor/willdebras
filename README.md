### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Will Bonnell and I work as a research assistant at NORC at the University of Chicago doing political survey research. I also help organize an group/set of events called the [R Community Collaboratives](https://chircollab.github.io/). I have three years of experience in R and SQL and about a year or two experience programming production dashboards in R Shiny, with some skills in CSS/JS. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [piece of a scrollytelling](https://willdebras.shinyapps.io/migration_2018/) built in R shiny displaying migration data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Julia, expanding my knowledge of statistical (Bayesian) methods, and applying to PhD programs in international relations.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interactive data visualisations and data journalism. I'm available for commission or collaboration. Some of my past vizes are available on [my website](https://willdebras.github.io/viz/).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about some of [my research](https://willdebras.github.io/cv/) on spatial influences on voting, how the hell the {openxlsx} package works, or why I think moral foundations theory is garbage.
